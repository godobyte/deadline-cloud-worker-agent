# The "allow_ec2_instance_profile" setting controls whether the Worker will run with an EC2 instance
# profile associated to the host instance. This value is overridden when the
# DEADLINE_WORKER_ALLOW_INSTANCE_PROFILE environment variable is set using one of the following
# case-insensitive values:
#
#     '0', 'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'.
#
# or if the --disallow-instance-profile command-line flag is specified.
#
# By default, this value is true and the worker agent will run with or without an instance profile
# if the worker is on an EC2 host. If this value is false, the worker host will query the EC2
# instance meta-data service (IMDS) to check for an instance profile. If an instance profile is
# detected, the worker agent will stop and exit.
