# AWS Deadline Cloud may tell the worker to stop. If the "shutdown_on_stop" setting below is true, then the
# Worker will attempt to shutdown the host system after the Worker has been stopped.
#
# This value is overridden when the DEADLINE_WORKER_NO_SHUTDOWN environment variable is set using
# one of the following case-insensitive values:
#
#     '0', 'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'.
#
# or if the --no-shutdown command-line flag is specified.
#
# To prevent the worker agent from shutting down the host when being told to stop, uncomment the
# line below:
shutdown_on_stop = true
